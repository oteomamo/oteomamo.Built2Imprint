                <p><i>“The wonder of the 20th century is undoubtedly La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, masterpiece of the famous architect Antoni Gaudi. Its designer used to say about it: My model is a tree. It has branches with leaves on them. And everything is developing harmoniously. A tree does not need help from the outside. Things themselves are in harmony. Everything is in equilibrium.”</i></p>

                        <div class="contwotext"><p class="p1"> The Basilica of the Sagrada Família, located in Barcelona, Catalonia, is an architectural work of art based on forms mainly inspired by nature and whose idea was conceived in 1883 by Antoni Gaudí, one of the most innovative architects of his time. The construction of this structure commenced in March 1882, as it was initially designed in a Neo-Gothic style by Francesc de Paula Villar, but a year later it was commissioned to the Spanish Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí, who redesigned it entirely.  Gaudí’s project was much more ambitious than that proposed by his predecessor. </p>
                 
                        <p class="p2">Wanting to create the perfect temple, Gaudi’s work presented the life of Jesus and the history of faith. This 560 feet structure that is ensconced by scalffolding, and towered over by cranes was designed as an honor to both God and the Roman Catholic Church. The 18 towers are dedicated to important biblical figures, which is evidently reflected in their size: 12 of them represent the apostles, 4 the evangelists, one the Virgin Mary and the highest of them all represent Jesus Christ, which would be topped by a cross reaching a height of 172 metres.</p>
                
                        <p class="p3">The columns of the central nave in the Sagrada Família have a peculiar history. They are forms geometrically designed in a special way which could not be built until the late 1980s, and with an unsuccessful trial between 1954 and 1956 due to its misinterpretation of the geometrical transitions height. In principle, Antoni Gaudí had left well defined columns for the subsequent construction. However, after his death, the chief architect of the construction of the church, Francesc Quintana, took the challenge of building the first column of the temple, known as the "column of Barcelona".The basilica also has three monumental façades each one representing one of the pivotal moments in the life of Christ.</p></div>

              <p class="card-text">Also known as ‘Façade of the Suffering’, its architecture symbolizes the suffering of Jesus Christ. With that thought in mind, Gaudi he wanted this façade to be austere and evoke pain and sacrifice. Its construction finished in 1989 exhibiting a completely different style. The main series of sculptures, on three levels, are in an S-shaped sequence, starting with the Last Supper at the bottom left, passing Christ crucified in the top center, and ending with Christ’s burial at the top right.</p>

The only things left after the bombing of Gaudi’s studio is the structural map and the symbolic plan. It is to be decorated with demons, saints, false gods, heresy and to depict the purgatory and death, as on the top it will have an image of the last judgment. The base is supposed to represent the Seven Deadly Sins; followed at the top by The Seven Heavenly Virtues. Moreover, the façade will rest on 8 large columns dedicated to the eight spiritual gifts.</p>

                    <p class="p7"> Among these three facades only the Nativity Facade was completed by Gaudí himself. The Passion Facade and the Glory Facade were built much later, and when the sculptures of Christ on the crucifix were added to the Passion Facade by Josep Maria Subirachs, many people argued that they were too abstract and took away from Gaudí’s style and vision as an artist and architect. Immediately in front of the Passion Facade, the Schools of Gaudí (Escoles de Gaudí) make up one of the architect's simpler gems. He built this as a children’s school in 1909, creating an original, undulating roof of brick that continues to charm architects to this day. There’s tons of symbolism in each part of Gaudí’s structure. Aside from the religious symbols, there are two others to look out for. First, the interior pillars actually resemble trees, and when you look up at them their shapes constantly change, as real trees appear to do. Also, there is a tortoise and turtle holding up these pillars, representing both the earth and the sea. La Sagrada Familia is an outstanding work of art with unique characteristics which brought the Modernisme style into new areas, as it fuses natural elements and shapes into architectural structures and artistic motifs. It was the most complex and unique project that Gaudí had carried out throughout his professional career, to which he dedicated 43 years of his life. Unfortunately, the 74 year old architect had a tragic accident where he was struck by a passing number 30 tram, resulting in his death three days later. </p>

                    <p class="p8"> Gaudí passed away in 1926, leaving his most important project, which he was devoted to, unfinished. He stated that, “His client” which is God, “can wait.", as the architect believed that giving tribute to God through his work means that the process should not be rushed and the project must be allowed to develop gradually. Since then, various architects have continued the work based on his original idea, mostly through fees paid by European agnostic tourists. Money for the construction is obtained by the many visits to this impressive monument and various donations. At the beginning of the Spanish Civil War (1936), in an atmosphere of strong and aggressive anti-clericalism, some revolutionaries set the crypt of La Sagrada Familia on fire and damaged Gaudi’s workshop. Orwell (1938) described ‘The Holy Family Church’ as a modern cathedral, and one of the most hideous buildings in the world. He said that unlike most of the churches in Barcelona, it was not damaged during the revolution – it was spared because of its ‘artistic value’, people said. However, Orwell thought the Anarchists showed bad taste in not blowing it up when they had the chance. In June 2010, Barcelona City Council began the refurbishment of the square of La Sagrada Familia, improving water infrastructure, paving, compacting and closing parterres, lighting, vegetation, renovating the urban furniture, and the refurbishment of recreational and leisure facilities. Furthermore, on 28th October, 2010, the Mayor of Barcelona issued the municipal edict ‘Barcelona welcomes Pope Benedict XVI,’ in which he praised the Catholic Church and asked citisens to be good hosts to His Holiness. The edict also mentioned La Sagrada Familia in terms of being one of Barcelona’s most beloved distinguishing elements. </p>

                    <p class="p8"> With it being an expiatory church, the construction cost was paid out of donations from the beginning until today. When Gaudi was alive, he once stated that the church “is made by the people and is mirrored in them. It is a work that is in the hand of God and the will of people.” (Collins, George) However, the complexity of the plan has led the church into a costly building. There was a time when the fund dried up and the construction become delayed. Even Gaudi himself had to contribute before he pleaded anyone if they could donor funds. The money issue has majorly delayed the construction and lengthened its duration. As Garcia-Fuentes (2011) explains, Gaudi’s work fell into oblivion and was rediscovered in 1950; since then its appreciation grew to become the main tourist attraction of Barcelona, known all around the world and visited by millions of people. Though a long way from being completed, La Sagrada Familia was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. It received the designation mostly because of its unique architecture and Gaudí’s ability to create something so innovative and artistic. It is believed that when La Sagrada Familia is completed, it will be tallest religious building in all of Europe, as the central tower in the middle will reach 170 meters tall. Despite having a powerful height, Gaudí believed that nothing man-made should ever be higher than God’s work. It is no coincidence that the ultimate height will be one meter less than Montjuïc, the mountain in Barcelona, which is also the city’s highest point. Nowdays this Cathedral receives more than two million tourists, most of whom are not even Catholics and is, as such, the most visited heritage site in Spain, ahead of the Prado Museum and the Alhambra. It would be safe to assume that this building is famous not only because of its religious significance, but because it is considered an extraordinary architectural masterpiece and work of art.</p>
